About arCHMage
==============

arCHMage  is  an  extensible  reader  and  decompiler for  files  in  the  CHM
format. This is the  format used by Microsoft HTML Help, and  is also known as
Compiled HTML.

arCHMage is written in the Python programming language and uses PyCHM - python
bindings for CHMLib from GnoCHM project.

Originally this utility  was written by Eugeny Korekin, but  since 2005 it has
been maintained and developed by Basil Shubin.


Features List
=============

  * Extracting CHM content
  * Dumping HTML data from CHM file as plain text (using external tools)
  * Converting CHM file into another file formats: Plain Text
  * Running as standalone http-server
  * Extension for Apache Web Server - mod_chm


System Requirements
===================

arCHMage requires the following libraries:

  * Python 2.3 or later
  * PyCHM
  * CHMLib

Other (optional) dependencies:

  * Lynx or ELinks - dumping HTML as plain text
  * mod_python - Apache/Python Integration


Installation
============

See INSTALL file for more details. 


Simple Usage HOWTO
==================

There is three ways to use arCHMage package now:

1) Extract CHM file content in to directory (directory will be created):

   archmage -x <chmfile> <directory>
   
   Note: Decompilation will fail, if destination directory already exist.

2) Dump HTML data from CHM file as plain text:

   archmage -d <chmfile>
   
   Note: All data dumped in to standard output. To use this feature you must
   have lynx or elinks text browser installed. See arch.conf for details.

3) Run as http-server, which will publish chm file contents on specified port.

   archmage -p <port> <chmfile>

   Note:  You  can first  decompress  chm file  into  directory  and use  this
   directory instead chm file, i.e: archmage -p <port> <chmdir>

4) Tune your apache to publish chm file contents if there is trailing slash in
   request to that file (you will need working mod_python for that):

   Add that lines to your httpd.conf:

      AddHandler python-program .chm
      PythonHandler archmod.mod_chm

   Restart apache.

   Let's suppose,  you have  file sample.chm in  DocumentRoot of  your apache.
   After that tuning  you can receive raw chm file, if  you point your browser
   to

   http://yourserver/sample.chm

   or you can view chm file on the fly if you point your browser to

   http://yourserver/sample.chm/ (note trailing slash)
